# Frontend v2

> Second iteration of the chatty frontend, implementing
> the v0.2 of the "Chatty protocol". First Chatty frontend
> to be implemented in React.

This was the most complete chatty frontend/backends ever,
with the ability to send real e2ee messages, create and
join chats, and send chat invites. It used to be functional
and hosted GitHub pages, but unfortunately the domain hosting the
[backend server](https://github.com/Chatty-Inc/chatty2-backend)
ceased to exist, breaking the whole app.

Unfortunately it lacked many crucial security protections
had quite a significant number of architecture flaws, that
development had to start from scratch with protocol v0.3.
You can find the frontend implementing that protocol
[here](https://github.com/Chatty-Inc/frontend).
